# Library Page Refactoring Overview

## Current Architecture Analysis

The library page implementation shows several layers of complexity:

1. Core Layer:
- Operation system (operations, queue, results)
- Folder system (models, storage, conflicts)
- State management (state manager, subscriptions)

2. UI Layer:
- Components (views, modals, context)
- Hooks (state, operations, effects)
- Event handling

3. Type System:
- Multiple type hierarchies
- Redundant type definitions
- Complex type relationships

## Key Issues Identified

1. Type System:
- Unnecessary inheritance (FolderBase → Folder → FolderItem)
- Multiple conflict types
- Redundant operation result types

2. Operation System:
- Mixed validation/conflict/execution logic
- Inconsistent error handling
- Complex state updates

3. State Management:
- UI state mirrors core state
- Complex state derivation
- Scattered operation handling

## Refactoring Priorities

1. Operation System (Highest Impact)
- Foundation for other changes
- Clear patterns to follow
- Immediate complexity reduction

2. Folder System (High Impact)
- Built on operation improvements
- Clear type consolidation
- Better error handling

3. State Management (Medium Impact)
- Depends on other improvements
- Clearer patterns emerge
- Better organization

## Success Metrics

1. Code Reduction:
- Fewer type definitions
- Less duplication
- Simpler interfaces

2. Better Organization:
- Clear operation flow
- Consistent patterns
- Better error handling

3. Improved Reliability:
- Type-safe operations
- Better error recovery
- Clear conflict handling
