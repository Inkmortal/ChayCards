# Knowledge Base

## Overview
The Knowledge Base is a planned feature that will allow users to create a personal knowledge repository by referencing external files (PDFs, videos, documents, etc.) without duplicating them. This feature is designed to integrate with the plugin system and future AI capabilities for enhanced knowledge management and retrieval.

## Current Implementation Status
⚠️ **Note: This feature is currently a UI placeholder only. No actual functionality has been implemented yet.**

### Implemented UI Components
- Knowledge Base page navigation and basic layout
- Resource organization interface
- AI interaction interface placeholders
- Knowledge visualization placeholders

### Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

#### 1. Resource Management
- File referencing system
  - Link to external files without copying
  - Track file metadata and relationships
  - Monitor file changes and updates
- Organization system
  - Hierarchical folders
  - Categories
  - Tags
  - Custom metadata

#### 2. Search and Navigation
- Full-text search across referenced documents
- Advanced filtering
  - By file type
  - By category
  - By tags
  - By date
- Sort options
  - Date added
  - Name
  - Type
  - Custom metadata

#### 3. AI Integration (Future)
- Document analysis and summarization
- Cross-document relationship discovery
- Smart search and question answering
- Content recommendations
- Knowledge graph generation

#### 4. Plugin Integration
- API for plugins to:
  - Access knowledge base contents
  - Query document relationships
  - Extend AI capabilities
  - Add custom visualizations
  - Implement specialized search features

## Technical Design

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface KnowledgeBaseEntry {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  path: string;
  type: 'pdf' | 'video' | 'image' | 'document' | 'other';
  addedAt: Date;
  tags: string[];
  category: string;
  folder: string;
}

interface PromptHistory {
  id: string;
  prompt: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  context: string[];  // IDs of documents used in context
}
```

### File Handling Strategy
- Store file references instead of copies
- Track file locations and metadata
- Monitor for file system changes
- Handle missing or moved files gracefully

### Planned Integration Points
1. Plugin System
   - Document processing hooks
   - Search extension points
   - Visualization interfaces
   - AI capability extensions

2. AI System
   - Vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Document relationship analysis
   - Natural language querying
   - Knowledge graph generation

## Future Development Priorities

1. Core Functionality
   - File reference system implementation
   - Basic organization features
   - Search and filter implementation

2. Plugin Integration
   - API development
   - Example plugin implementations
   - Documentation

3. AI Features
   - Document analysis
   - Semantic search
   - Knowledge graph
   - Question answering

4. UI/UX Improvements
   - Performance optimizations
   - Advanced visualizations
   - Improved navigation
   - Batch operations

## Contributing
The Knowledge Base feature is under active development. Key areas for contribution include:
- File system integration
- Search implementation
- Plugin API design
- AI integration
- UI/UX improvements

## Usage (When Implemented)
The Knowledge Base will allow users to:
1. Add references to external files
2. Organize content using folders, categories, and tags
3. Search and filter their knowledge base
4. Use AI features to analyze and understand their content
5. Integrate with plugins for extended functionality

## Known Limitations
- Currently only a UI placeholder
- No actual file system integration
- No search functionality
- No AI features implemented
- No plugin integration implemented
